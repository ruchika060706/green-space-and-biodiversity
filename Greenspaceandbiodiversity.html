    <p>
        Green spaces, such as parks, gardens, and urban forests, are vital for preserving biodiversity—the variety of life—within urban environments. As cities expand, they often replace natural habitats, leading to habitat loss and fragmentation. Green spaces combat this by providing essential habitats, food, and shelter for a wide array of species, from birds and insects to small mammals and native plants. The quality of these spaces, measured by factors like size, plant diversity, and connectivity, directly influences their ability to support a thriving ecosystem.
    </p>

    <p>
        Beyond simply acting as isolated refuges, green spaces serve as crucial ecological corridors, creating a network of connected habitats. This allows species to move safely throughout the urban landscape, preventing genetic isolation and supporting healthier, more resilient populations. For instance, a series of connected parks or tree-lined streets can act as a "stepping stone" for pollinators like bees and butterflies, ensuring their ability to access resources and maintain local plant populations. This interconnectedness is essential for the overall health of the urban ecosystem.
    </p>

    <p>
        The biodiversity within green spaces provides critical ecosystem services that benefit humans. Trees and plants filter air and water, mitigate the urban heat island effect by providing shade and cooling, and help manage stormwater runoff. By supporting diverse plant and animal life, these areas also contribute to natural pest control and pollination, which are vital for local food production. Ultimately, the strategic integration and thoughtful management of green spaces are fundamental to creating sustainable, livable, and ecologically balanced cities.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Green spaces act as biodiversity hotspots by supporting native and migratory species, with even small gardens contributing to pollinator populations like bees and butterflies, which are crucial for ecosystem health.</li>
        <li>The ecological value of green spaces is enhanced by their structural complexity, including canopy cover, tree height, and understory vegetation, which positively influence bird and arthropod diversity.</li>
        <li>Urban green spaces contribute to climate resilience by moderating temperatures, reducing the urban heat island effect, and absorbing stormwater to prevent flooding, while also improving air and water quality.</li>

    <p>
        Urban green spaces are critically important for supporting biodiversity and providing essential ecosystem services that benefit both wildlife and human well-being. Research indicates that these spaces serve as vital habitats, wildlife corridors, and biodiversity hotspots, helping to maintain ecological balance in urban environments. They also contribute significantly to climate regulation, air and water purification, and flood prevention, while supporting pollinators and natural pest control.
    </p>

    <h2>Habitat and Biodiversity Support</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Green spaces provide shelter, breeding grounds, and food sources for a wide range of species, including birds, insects, mammals, and plants, acting as refuges in areas where natural habitats are scarce.</li>
        <li>Even small green spaces can support significant biodiversity by providing resources like flowering trees and native vegetation for food and shelter.</li>
        <li>The presence of diverse plant species in these areas promotes biodiversity, supporting both native and migratory species.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ecosystem Services</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetation in green spaces absorbs pollutants, filters rainwater, reduces stormwater runoff, and sequesters carbon, improving air and water quality and mitigating climate change.</li>
        <li>They play a crucial role in moderating urban temperatures by providing shade and cooling through evapotranspiration, thereby reducing the urban heat island effect.</li>
        <li>Green spaces enhance soil health by preventing erosion and supporting microbial communities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Human Well-being and Social Benefits</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Green spaces are linked to improved mental and physical health, offering opportunities for recreation, social interaction, and psychological restoration.</li>
        <li>They foster a connection to nature, raising awareness of conservation and supporting community engagement.</li>
        <li>The presence of biodiversity within these spaces has been associated with enhanced psychological well-being.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Planning and Management</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Studies show that urban green spaces can effectively serve both human utility and biodiversity goals simultaneously.</li>
        <li>Larger spaces and features like nature preserves, bodies of water, and dog parks correlate positively with biodiversity.</li>
        <li>The concept of "land sharing," which involves integrating numerous small, multifunctional green spaces throughout the urban landscape, promotes biodiversity, climate resilience, and equitable access to nature.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Urban green spaces, while vital for supporting biodiversity, face significant threats from urbanization, habitat fragmentation, and the homogenization of soil microbial communities, which can reduce ecosystem resilience to climate change. Despite their role in providing habitat and ecosystem services, the effectiveness of these spaces is challenged by the dominance of non-native species, simplified vegetation, and the increasing pressure of urban expansion.
    </p>

    <p>
        Urban parks and residential green spaces exhibit higher soil biodiversity than nearby forests and farmlands, but this diversity is becoming increasingly homogenized across cities, potentially making these ecosystems less resilient to large-scale environmental changes.
    </p>

    <p>
        The introduction of invasive species, pollution, and habitat loss due to infrastructure development are major threats to urban biodiversity, disrupting ecological processes and diminishing the benefits provided by green spaces.
    </p>

    <p>
        Informal green spaces, such as utility easements and brownfield sites, contribute significantly to urban species richness and should be integrated into planning alongside formal parks to enhance biodiversity outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Simple interventions like increasing understorey vegetation and planting native species can substantially improve biodiversity in urban green spaces by supporting a wider range of species.
    </p>

    <p>
        The success of green space initiatives, as seen in Singapore, demonstrates that connected networks of parks and green corridors can boost biodiversity, but these efforts face challenges from high costs, maintenance demands, and the need for sustained community and financial support.
