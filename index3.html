        <p>
            Green spaces, such as parks, gardens, and urban forests, are vital for preserving biodiversity—the variety of life—within urban environments. As cities expand, they often replace natural habitats, leading to habitat loss and fragmentation. Green spaces combat this by providing essential habitats, food, and shelter for a wide array of species, from birds and insects to small mammals and native plants. The quality of these spaces, measured by factors like size, plant diversity, and connectivity, directly influences their ability to support a thriving ecosystem.

           
            Beyond simply acting as isolated refuges, green spaces serve as crucial ecological corridors, creating a network of connected habitats. This allows species to move safely throughout the urban landscape, preventing genetic isolation and supporting healthier, more resilient populations. For instance, a series of connected parks or tree-lined streets can act as a "stepping stone" for pollinators like bees and butterflies, ensuring their ability to access resources and maintain local plant populations. This interconnectedness is essential for the overall health of the urban ecosystem.

            
            The biodiversity within green spaces provides critical ecosystem services that benefit humans. Trees and plants filter air and water, mitigate the urban heat island effect by providing shade and cooling, and help manage stormwater runoff. By supporting diverse plant and animal life, these areas also contribute to natural pest control and pollination, which are vital for local food production. Ultimately, the strategic integration and thoughtful management of green spaces are fundamental to creating sustainable, livable, and ecologically balanced cities.

           
            Urban green spaces are vital for supporting biodiversity, providing essential habitats, shelter, and breeding grounds for a wide range of species including birds, insects, mammals, and plants, acting as refuges in areas where natural habitats are scarce. Research indicates that these spaces can serve multiple purposes simultaneously, with little to no trade-off between human utility and biodiversity, as larger green spaces and those with greater habitat complexity, such as diverse vegetation and structural layers, support higher species richness and contribute to ecosystem resilience. The presence of biodiversity within green spaces is also strongly linked to human psychological well-being, with studies showing that biodiversity predicts a significant portion of the restorative benefits people experience in parks, regardless of age, gender, or ethnicity.

        <ul>
            <li>Green spaces act as biodiversity hotspots by supporting native and migratory species, with even small gardens contributing to pollinator populations like bees and butterflies, which are crucial for ecosystem health.</li>
            
            <li>The ecological value of green spaces is enhanced by their structural complexity, including canopy cover, tree height, and understory vegetation, which positively influence bird and arthropod diversity.</li>
           
            <li>Urban green spaces contribute to climate resilience by moderating temperatures, reducing the urban heat island effect, and absorbing stormwater to prevent flooding, while also improving air and water quality.</li>
            
            <li>The concept of "Single Large or Several Small" (SLOSS) spaces suggests that a network of smaller green spaces distributed across a city can promote biodiversity accumulation more effectively than a single large space of equal area, highlighting the importance of connectivity and landscape-scale planning.</li>
           
            <li>As of September 2025, recent research continues to emphasize the need for integrated planning that considers both ecological function and human well-being, advocating for transdisciplinary approaches to design and manage green spaces that maximize benefits for both people and nature.</li>
