        <p>
            Urban green spaces are critically important for supporting biodiversity and providing essential ecosystem services that benefit both wildlife and human well-being. Research indicates that these spaces serve as vital habitats, wildlife corridors, and biodiversity hotspots, helping to maintain ecological balance in urban environments. They also contribute significantly to climate regulation, air and water purification, and flood prevention, while supporting pollinators and natural pest control.
        </p>

        <h2>Habitat and Biodiversity Support</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Green spaces provide shelter, breeding grounds, and food sources for a wide range of species, including birds, insects, mammals, and plants, acting as refuges in areas where natural habitats are scarce.</li>
            <li>Even small green spaces can support significant biodiversity by providing resources like flowering trees and native vegetation for food and shelter.</li>
            <li>The presence of diverse plant species in these areas promotes biodiversity, supporting both native and migratory species.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ecosystem Services</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Vegetation in green spaces absorbs pollutants, filters rainwater, reduces stormwater runoff, and sequesters carbon, improving air and water quality and mitigating climate change.</li>
            <li>They play a crucial role in moderating urban temperatures by providing shade and cooling through evapotranspiration, thereby reducing the urban heat island effect.</li>
            <li>Green spaces enhance soil health by preventing erosion and supporting microbial communities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Human Well-being and Social Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Green spaces are linked to improved mental and physical health, offering opportunities for recreation, social interaction, and psychological restoration.</li>
            <li>They foster a connection to nature, raising awareness of conservation and supporting community engagement.</li>
            <li>The presence of biodiversity within these spaces has been associated with enhanced psychological well-being.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Planning and Management</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Studies show that urban green spaces can effectively serve both human utility and biodiversity goals simultaneously.</li>
            <li>Larger spaces and features like nature preserves, bodies of water, and dog parks correlate positively with biodiversity.</li>
            <li>The concept of "land sharing," which involves integrating numerous small, multifunctional green spaces throughout the urban landscape, promotes biodiversity, climate resilience, and equitable access to nature.</li>
        </ul>
